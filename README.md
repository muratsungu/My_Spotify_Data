# My_Spotify_Data
I recently accessed my Spotify account data. Since the incoming data is in JSON format, I could not decide how to monitor it. I did some research on the internet and transferred the data in JSON format to SQL Server.
Includes My Library JSON file and script for import SQL Server.
This is a basic example.
